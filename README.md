# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
The projects goal was to write a modular ML model and test and log all its functions. 
bank_data.csv was used to predict who is likely to churn.

## Files and data description
* bank_data.csv: the model was trained and tested on this dataset
* churn_library.py: ML model in modular form. (pylint gives 7.24 points) 
* churn_script_logging_and_tests.py: testing and logging generating file. (pylint gives 8.33 points)
* images folder: contains plots of explanatory analysis and results in subfolders
* logs folder: churn_library.log file contains the logs 
* models: contains two trained models

## Running Files
How do you run your files? What should happen when you run your files?
* churn_library.py: can be run from terminal by ipython churn_library.py or py -m pylint churn_library.py. It generates the files inside the images folder and the models
* churn_library: can be run from terminal by ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py or py -m pylint churn_script_logging_and_tests.py. It generates the churn_library.log file inside logs folder
